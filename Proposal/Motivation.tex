Analysis of algorithms on abstract machines serves as a crucial tool for benchmarking and increasing the scope for further improvement. Till now we were satisfied using the RAM and the EM model to perform our algorithmic analysis accurately. But this paper observes discrepancies with some experimental findings and tries to push forward another model that accounts for these discrepancies. Now, before we all shift to this new model, we have to carefully verify its claims and correctness. This is where the paper lacks input. The paper does mention that experimental findings tally with the theoretical predictions of the new VAT model, but it doesnâ€™t clearly represent these findings. Also the number of test cases seems to be limited. So before we readily accept this new model for theoretically analyzing the running time of algorithms we need to broaden our test set and verify and compare the experimental results. The challenging part would be to calculate the running time complexities in the new VAT model. If we can verify and prove by experimental comparison that the new VAT model is more accurate then this will serve as an incentive to people to start using the proposed model for more accurate estimations of running time of algorithms.*
