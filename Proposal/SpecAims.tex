Our main aim is to experimentally verify the accuracy of the VAT model for finding out the running time of algorithms, over the traditional RAM and EM models that we are all used to. The contributions to this study that we would like to make are analyzing a different set of algorithms, other than the ones already done by this paper, and performing a direct comparison amongst the above findings and the theoretical results of the old and the proposed model. By doing so, we aim to provide a concrete evidence that will either support moving to this new model or disprove all its claims.*
