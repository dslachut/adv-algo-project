\section{Deliverables}
  This project will produce four final products.
  \paragraph{Progress Report} The investigators will submit a report on the
  status of the research, noting significant changes to the research or
  newly uncovered difficulties. This report will also include a draft outline
  of the final report.
  \paragraph{Final Report} The project will produce a final report to answer
  the question of which, whether RAM or VAT, is the more accurate model of
  modern computation. This determination will be based on three factors.
    \subparagraph{Algorithm Analyses} The investigators will do algorithm
    runtime analyses of a set of algorithms. The conclusions of the two models
    will be compared.
    \subparagraph{Benchmark Results} The report will include the results of
    real-world benchmarking of procedures based on the selected algorithms.
    \subparagraph{Source Code} The report will be accompanied by the source
    code for the benchmarking evaluations.
  \paragraph{Presentation Slides} The project will produce an oral presentation
  and accompanying slides. The presentation will be a summary of the project
  report noting the key findings of the research.
