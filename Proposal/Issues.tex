\section{Issues}
  There are two primary difficulties to be overcome for the completion of the
  project.
  \paragraph{VAT Analysis} As the Virtual Address Translation computing model
  is very new, little can be known about it. Prior to starting this project,
  the investigators know of only two people who currently understand the model
  and have done work with it. This means two things.
    \subparagraph{Will the model work} Prior to beginning the project, the
    investigators cannot know if algorithm analysis under the new model will be
    a tractable problem in every attempted case.
    \subparagraph{Lack of helpful resources} There is necessarily a lack of
    resources to assist the investigators should the model prove especially
    difficult to master.
  \paragraph{Benchmarking} It may be difficult to devise the most correct way
  to benchmark the running times of the implementations of the selected
  algorithms. Each tested procedure must run multiple times on multiple, varied
  inputs, and perhaps even on different operating systems to determine if
  there is a single model of computation that is superior.
