\section{Plan}
To achieve our aims, we have laid out the following plan:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Implement different sets of algorithms in some high level language
      and then measure the running time.
      \item Theoretically calculate the running time in the RAM model
      \item Theoretically calculate the running time in the proposed VAT model
      \item Compare the results amongst the above and then measure which model
has a result closer to the actual measured running time
We also plan to implement and measure as many algorithms as possible so that our findings are generalized. The challenge is to carefully select algorithms from different categories for measurement and also to correctly calculate the complexities using the proposed VAT model.*
  \end{itemize}
