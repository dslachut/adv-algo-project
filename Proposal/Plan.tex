\section{Plan}
To achieve our aims, we have laid out the following plan:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implement different sets of algorithms in some high level language
    and then measure the running time.
    \item Theoretically calculate the running time in the RAM model
    \item Theoretically calculate the running time in the proposed VAT model
    \item Compare the results amongst the above and then measure which model
    has a result closer to the actual measured running time.
  \end{itemize}
  
  We also plan to implement and measure several algorithms to generalize our
  findings. We must carefully select algorithms from different categories for
  measurement and correctly calculate the complexities using the proposed VAT
  model.
