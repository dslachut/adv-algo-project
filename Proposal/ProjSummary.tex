\section{Project Summary}

\paragraph{General Area:} Models of Computation in Algorithms

\paragraph{Keywords:} RAM, computational models, benchmark

\paragraph{Question:} The RAM model of computation is the traditionally
assumed environment of most algorithm analysis, but it is questionable whether
it serves as an accurate model of modern computers. This project will
experimentally test the RAM model versus the recently proposed VAT model.
\emph{Is Jurkiewicz and Mehlhorn's Virtual Address Translation model
experimentally superior to the traditional Random Access Machine for modeling
computational complexity?}

\paragraph{Responsibilities:}

\paragraph{Budget:} \$6,165.92
