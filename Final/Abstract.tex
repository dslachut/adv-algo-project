  Modern computers do not access memory in constant time, though the random
  access machine model of computation assumes they do. A new model of
  computation that reflects the reality of expensive memory access might allow
  more accurate algorithm analysis. This paper experimentally compares the
  random access machine to the new virtual address translation model and
  concludes that the random access machine is a more accurate, more usable tool
  for analyzing algorithms.
