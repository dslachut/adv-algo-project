\section{Previous Work}

Most work on algorithms tends to ignore the cost of virtual address translation
[4], though researchers recognize these costs [5,6]. Virtualized memory is
not accounted for in the standard random access machine model of computation,
which treats all memory accesses as constant-time operations. Most algorithm
analysis uses this RAM model. Papers like “The cost of virtualization” by
Ulrich Drepper [6] and other materials like “AMD64 Architecture Programmer’s
Manual Vol 2” [2] describe the implementation of virtual memory and its
associated costs during translation; but no study has tried to develop a model
that considers these costs for algorithmic analysis prior to the recently
proposed VAT model.

Keeping this trend in mind, it is not surprising that there has been little
related work that carefully verifies the experimental results and strengthens
the new model that accounts for these costs. This paper's contribution,
experimentally examining and comparing the proposed model to the older model,
begins to fill this gap.
