\section{Future Work}
This paper leaves open some possibilities for future work. In the first place,
mathematical models are always up for refinement. No mathematical construct
has been found that can perfectly simulate the physical universe. Thus, there
is always room for improvements to the model.

With respect the the analysis and conclusions given in this paper, one might
see that the analysis was conducted on consumer grade, personal computer
hardware. This analysis may not necessarily apply to situations involving big
data, servers, cloud computing, or new technology. Perhaps there is not a
single mathematical model to precisely describe every arrangement. These areas 
are worth further study.
