\section{Methods}
  Here we describe in excruciating detail what we did.
  
  \subsection{Implementations}
  We took a set of standard reference algorithms including permute, and heapsort.
  We turned them into C procedures.
  We ran each one a dozen times on each of a wide variety of sizes of inputs.
  On each run, we timed the execution.
  We then took those running times and figured their growth rates.
  This gives us real world running times.
