\section{Discussion}

This is where we discuss results.

  \subsection{RAM vs Reality}
    Here is where we will compare the benchmark results with the standard runtimes.
    This will need a table to compare the two algorithm-by-algorithm.

  \subsection{VAT vs Reality}
    Here is where we will compare the benchmark results with the new model's runtimes.
    This will need a table to compare the two algorithm-by-algorithm.

  \subsection{VAT vs RAM}
    The big finale, old vs new, here is where we will declare a winner between RAM
    and VAT.
    This will likewise need a table.
    Really all three tables could be combined into one good chart for the whole section.
