\section{Introduction}
  
  We solved the problem of demonstrating whether the Virtual Address Translation
  (VAT) model of computation--presented by Jurkiewicz and Mehlhorn--is a 
  better model than the Random Access Machine (RAM) model for analyzing the 
  performace of algorithms when implemented on modern computing hardware.
  
  The novel contribution includes not only the benchmarking of these procedures,
  but also the comparative analysis of the two models.

  This work could be very significant if VAT is indeed superior to RAM. We would
  be the first to independently verify this and we would be contributing some of
  the first analysis of common, reference algorithms.
