\section{Introduction}
  
  The Random Access Machine (RAM) model of computation is widely used for
  analyzing the performace of algorithms. Some, such as Jurkiewicz and Mehlhorn
  [5] question whether this model accurately represents the complexities of
  modern hardware. They propose the Virtual Address Translation (VAT) model of
  computation to account for added complexities, such as the memory address
  translation needed to refference ever larger amounts of system memory in 
  modern computers.
  
  This paper analyzes a set of algorithms using both models, VAT and RAM,
  and presents the results of benchmarking these algorithms on real hardware.
  The goal of this is to then use the results of the analysis and benchmarks
  to determine which model more accurately reflects the real hardware.
  
  The novel contribution includes not only the benchmarking of these procedures,
  but also the comparative analysis of the two models. This work is significant
  because it could have shown the benefit to adopting a new model of
  computation into standard use and because it does confirm the continued
  viability of the standard RAM model.

  This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the paper's
  motivation. Section 3 addresses previous work. Section 4 details how the
  benchmarks and analyses were done. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6
  discusses the results, selecting the more accurate model. Section 7 and 8 
  address the potential for future work and conclude the paper.
