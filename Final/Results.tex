\section{Results}

  Here the results are presented. First come predictions of running times
  generated by the RAM model. Then come the analyses of the algorithms under
  the VAT model. Last are the results of benchmarking the algorithms.

  \subsection{RAM}
    This paper selected five reference algorithms, with running times well 
    studied under the RAM model.
    
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      Algorithm     & Average Case  & Worst Case   \\
      BinarySearch  & $O(\log(n))$  & $O(\log(n))$ \\
      Heapsort      & $O(n\log(n))$ & $O(n\log(n))$\\
      Insertionsort & $O(n^2)$      & $O(n^2)$     \\
      Permute       & $O(n)$        & $O(n)$       \\
      Quicksort     & $O(n\log(n))$ & $O(n^2)$     \\
    \end{tabular}

  \subsection{VAT}
     This subsection will have a little more to it than the RAM section. There
     will be a table telling about the calculated running times of our 
     algorithms. There might also be some text describing some of the 
     difficulties or nuances of doing the analyses with the new model.

  \subsection{Benchmarks}
     This subsection will have some text explaining several charts that show
     empirically discovered running times of our various procedures.
