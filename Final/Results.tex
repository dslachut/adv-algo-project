\section{Results}

We present our experimental findings in this section. We have included the actual running times of the algorithms on a test machine and the theoretical running times in the RAM and the new VAT model. Till now we have been able to test the following algorithms:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Insertion Sort
    \item Heap Sort
    \item Quick Sort
    \item Permute
    \item Binary Search
  \end{itemize}
  
By the time we are ready with our final paper, we would have included a few more algorithms to get a broader result.
  
  \subsection{Benchmarks}
     This subsection will have some text explaining several charts that show
     empirically discovered running times of our various procedures.

  \subsection{RAM}
     This subsection will be fairly brief, with a table listing the runtimes
     every one 'knows' these reference algorithms have.

  \subsection{VAT}
     This subsection will have a little more to it than the RAM section. There
     will be a table telling about the calculated running times of our 
     algorithms. There might also be some text describing some of the 
     difficulties or nuances of doing the analyses with the new model.
