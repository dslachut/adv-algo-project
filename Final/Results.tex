\section{Results}

  We need actual results to write this section, but it will be divided into
  three subsections.

  \subsection{Benchmarks}
     This subsection will have some text explaining several charts that show
     empirically discovered running times of our various procedures.

  \subsection{RAM}
     This subsection will be fairly brief, with a table listing the runtimes
     every one 'knows' these reference algorithms have.

  \subsection{VAT}
     This subsection will have a little more to it than the RAM section. There
     will be a table telling about the calculated running times of our 
     algorithms. There might also be some text describing some of the 
     difficulties or nuances of doing the analyses with the new model.
