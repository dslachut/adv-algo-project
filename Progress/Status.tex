\section{Status}
  
  Using the original schedule as a plan, the project team began work on the
  project. They here note the progress in carrying out the plan, and discuss
  the work they will accomplish moving forward.
  
  \subsection{Progress}
    The team's primary accomplishment thus far is in implementing a set of
    standard reference algorithms as procedures in C. By selecting algorithms
    such as heapsort, permute, binary search, etc., they bypassed need to 
    analyze these procedures under the RAM model, as these algorithms are
    already well understood and well documented.
    
    Additionally, the team has attended to it's overhead responsibilities by
    delivering this progress report with its accompanying outline of the final
    report.
    
  \subsection{Remaining Work}
    
   Much remains to be done. The step of benchmarking the procedures on real
   hardware has taken longer than intended, as has the task of understanding
   the VAT model of computation. However, these difficulties were forseen and
   the next section of this report comments more fully on them.
   
   Also remaining is the work originally scheduled for the next several weeks.
   The selected algorithms must be analyzed using the VAT model. Following such
   analyses, the team will present its findings in draft and final reports and,
   possibly, in a presentation.
