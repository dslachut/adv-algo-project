\section{Issues}
  In the project proposal, the project team noted two primary
  difficulties to be overcome for the completion of the project. They were:
  
  \paragraph{VAT Analysis:} As the Virtual Address Translation computing model
  is very new, little can be known about it. Prior to starting this project,
  the investigators know of only two people who currently understand the model
  and have done work with it. This entails some things.
    \subparagraph{Will the model work:} Prior to beginning the project, the
    investigators cannot know if algorithm analysis under the new model will be
    a tractable problem in every attempted case.
    \subparagraph{Complexity:} Even the tractable analyses will be
    substantially more complex than the corresponding analyses done with the
    RAM model.
    \subparagraph{Lack of helpful resources:} There is necessarily a lack of
    resources to assist the investigators should the model prove especially
    difficult to master or the analyses especially difficult to formulate.
    
  \paragraph{Benchmarking:} It may be difficult to devise the most correct way
  to benchmark the running times of the implementations of the selected
  algorithms. Each tested procedure must run multiple times on multiple, varied
  inputs, and perhaps even on different operating systems to determine if
  there is a single model of computation that is superior.
  
  \paragraph{} These two areas remain the two primary difficulties being
  overcome.
